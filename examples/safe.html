    <h1>SafeMail Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: January 25, 2026</p>
    <p>Welcome to SafeMail. We built this service because we believe privacy is a human right. Our business model is simple: you pay us a subscription fee, and we provide a secure email service. We do not sell your data.</p>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Your Content is Yours</h2>
        <p>You retain full ownership of all emails, contacts, and files you store on SafeMail. <span class="highlight">We do not claim any intellectual property rights over the material you provide to the Service.</span> Your profile and materials remain yours.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. No Tracking or Ads</h2>
        <p>SafeMail is completely ad-free. <span class="highlight">We do not track your usage, we do not scan your emails for keywords, and we do not build a profile of you for advertisers.</span> We have no third-party tracking scripts on our website or in our app.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Data Encryption</h2>
        <p>All data is encrypted at rest and in transit. We use end-to-end encryption for emails sent between SafeMail users. This means even we cannot read your emails.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>If you are not satisfied with SafeMail, you can cancel your account at any time. <span class="highlight">We offer a full 30-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked.</span> After 30 days, we will refund the pro-rated remaining balance of your subscription.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Termination</h2>
        <p>You are free to stop using our Services at any time. We reserve the right to suspend or end the Services at any time at our discretion and without notice, but only if you have materially breached these Terms (e.g. using the service for illegal spam or fraud). In such cases, we will provide you with an opportunity to export your data unless forbidden by law.</p>
