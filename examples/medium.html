        <h2>1. Subscription & Auto-Renewal</h2>
        <p>Your StreamFlix membership will continue month-to-month until you choose to cancel. To ensure uninterrupted service, your subscription automatically renews each month. You may cancel at any time via your account settings to avoid future charges.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Service Updates</h2>
        <p>We are constantly improving StreamFlix. We may update our prices or service tiers to reflect new content and features. We will always notify you at least 30 days in advance of any price changes, giving you time to decide if you wish to continue.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Data Usage</h2>
        <p>We use data about your viewing history to personalize recommendations and improve our streaming quality (e.g., caching frequently watched shows). We do not sell your personal viewing history to third-party data brokers.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Refunds</h2>
        <p>If you are unhappy with the service, you may request a full refund within 7 days of your initial purchase or any renewal charge if you haven't watched any content during that period.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>StreamFlix aims to provide a continuous service, but we cannot guarantee that the service will be free from interruptions or errors (e.g., internet outages). Our liability is limited to the amount you paid for the service in the last 12 months.</p>
